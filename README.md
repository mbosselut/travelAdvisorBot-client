# Travel Advisor bot

This is the front-end implementation of the Travel Advisor bot. It was programmed through DialogFlow, for a Codaisseur hackathon themed around Travel.

The front-end app was built with React & Redux, and connected to the chatbot backend with the api-ai-javascript package.

## To install :
`git clone` , `npm install`, `npm start`


The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mbosselut/travelAdvisorBot-backend) but cannot be cloned and ran locally (the backend is deployed and the front-end can work on its own).

### Future functionalities / add-ons:
* Move pictures to database and fetch on request
* Add optional parameters to refine the recommandation
* Add functionality to buttons, for instance linking to hotel reservations
* Answer requests about specific countries
